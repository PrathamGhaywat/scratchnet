WARNING: STILL BUILDING SO INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO USE WILL NOT WORK

# ScratchNet - A Neural Network built from Scratch

This is a Neural Network built from Scratch using Python and NumPy. 

## How to use

To run this please follow the set of instructions below.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Python 3.13
2. Pip
3. Git (optional)

First clone the Repository (Alternatively you can download the ZIP file via clicking on the "<> Code" button and then navigating to the "Local" Tab and clicking on the "Download ZIP" option. Then you can extract it onto your Desktop):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrathamGhaywat/scratchnet.git
```

OPTIONAL: Creating an Virtual Enviroment will help you seprate the libraries from your main python compiler and mitigates the risk of corrupting it:

```bash
python -m venv scratchnet

#Activate the venv: on Linux and MacOS it would be different: source scratchnet/bin/activate
./scratchnet/scripts/activate
```

Then run main.py

```bash
python src/main.py
```

After that you can follow the set of options that will be provided to you.
